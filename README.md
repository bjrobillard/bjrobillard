# College Projects
###  Benjamin Robillard
The purpose of this repository is to showcase some kattis problems I have solved to give insight into what I've learned during my time at CMU. You can access the code solutions in my repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/bjrobillard/bjrobillard)
<!-- The purpose of this repository is to showcase some of the projects I enjoyed working on during my college career. It includes projects from: Object Oriented Programming, User Interface Design, Networking, UNIX, Kattis Problem Solutions

---
## Object Oriented Programming ('OOP-Sp23')
This folder contains projects such as a couple kattis problems I was required to do as well as my final student showcase project that was presented to the school at the end of the semester. The Student Showcase project was an AI maitching game called, 'M Ai T C H' where users can play a game of memory matching or they can change a variable in the code to have the game play itself - though there is no REAL Ai playing the game it still does play itself (see abstract for more information).

---
## User Interface Design ('UI-Fall23')
This folder contains work from my Spring 2023 class for User Interface design. It contains my final project which was also presented to the school for Student Showcase. The project was for a mobile app that allowed users to post a picture of a place they went to gain points and to motivate their friends to compete to see who got the most points (see abstract for more information).

## UNIX ('UNIX-Fall23')
This folder contains some projects from my UNIX class I took in the Spring of 2023. One of the projects is  -->

## Kattis Problem Solutions ('Kattis-Problems')
This folder contains Kattis Problem Solutions some of which have: Unittesting and mypy to test functionality, Coverage Reporting to show how much of the code is tested, and plantuml to help explain the different classes used, their data types and the relationships between functions in the class. Other kattis problem solutions only have the solutions and use a different style of coding than object oriented. An example of the testing used can be seen from the abstract file ([Abstract](/Kattis-Problems/Python/abstract/)) solving the [Stacking Cups](https://open.kattis.com/problems/cups) Kattis Problem)

- Pytest

- TypeCheck

From a different solution (Folder: [Unittesting](/Kattis-Problems/Python/unittesting/)), here is an example of how plantuml was used to display a uml diagram of the classes used to solve the "Morse Code Palindrome" problem ([Morse Code Palindrome](https://open.kattis.com/problems/morsecodepalindromes)).

These are some examples of how I used different testing libraries to help prove the functionality of the programs I made to solve the problems.
<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
