I just wanted to include some notes in case you didn't see the ones in my Makefile...
    - The coverage reports aren't at 100% but they're within ~20% so I thought that would be enough to show 
        that I know how to use Coverage
    - I also did what you said to get the coverage htmlcov to show up in my repo by deleting the .gitignore but 
        it still isn't showing up in there
